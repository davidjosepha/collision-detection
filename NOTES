int * x             : declaring an int pointer
void foo(int * x)   : foo takes an int pointer as an argument
*x                  : dereference the pointer x


int & x             : declaring an int reference (never get to change what it references)
void foo(int & x)   : foo takes an int passed to it by reference
&x                  : address of the pointer



Object vector should be a vector of Object const * const
Make sure everything that can be const is const
Make method titles better
